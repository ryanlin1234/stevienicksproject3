# Stevie Nicks Discography Analysis

Author: Ryan Lin  
Date: 2025-11-07

## Project overview

This project analyzes the audio features and popularity of tracks from Stevie Nicks’s solo studio albums.  
Using track-level data (e.g., popularity, energy, duration), the analysis focuses on:

- How average album popularity changes over time.
- How album energy levels compares across her career and relative to an overall calculated average.

The main outputs are two visualizations:

1. Average popularity by album over time.
2. Album energy over her career compared to the overall average energy.

## Directory structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Stevie Nicks Discography.Rproj` — RStudio project file.
- `README.md` — this file.

- `data/`
  - `StevieNicksAlbumTracks.csv` — raw track-level data for Stevie Nicks’s solo albums.

- `doc/`
  - `stevienicksdiscography.Rmd` — main analysis document (loads data, cleans it, runs analysis, and creates plots).
  - `stevienicksdiscography.html` — knitted HTML report (created when you knit the Rmd).

- `src/`
  - `sn_discography_data_cleaning.R` — script that loads and cleans the raw data and creates `sn_discography_clean`.
  - `sn_discography_functions.R` — helper functions used in the analysis (e.g., `is_above_average()`, `make_simple_label()`).

- `results/`
  - `SN_album_popularity.pdf` — saved plot of average album popularity by year/album.
  - `SN_album_energy_comparison.pdf` — saved plot comparing album energy to the overall average.

*(The PDF files in `results/` are created by the R Markdown file using `ggsave()` when you knit.)*

## How to run the analysis

1. Open `Stevie Nicks Discography.Rproj` in RStudio to set the working directory correctly.
2. Make sure the required R packages are installed (see **Dependencies** below).
3. In the RStudio Files pane, open `doc/stevienicksdiscography.Rmd`.
4. Click **Knit** (to HTML).
   - The Rmd will:
     - Read the raw data from `data/StevieNicksAlbumTracks.csv`.
     - Source cleaning and functions scripts from `src/`.
     - Perform the analysis and generate summary objects.
     - Create and save the plots in `results/`:
       - `SN_album_popularity.pdf`
       - `SN_album_energy_comparison.pdf`
     - Produce an HTML report (`doc/stevienicksdiscography.html`).

After knitting, you can view the visualizations in the HTML report and/or open the PDF files in `results/`.

## Data description

The analysis uses a CSV file named `StevieNicksAlbumTracks.csv`, which contains track-level information for Stevie Nicks’s solo albums.
This dataset originated from a dataset named "Stevie Nicks Studio Tracks (with Spotify Data)" on Kaggle.

Key columns include:

- `Album` — Name of the studio album.
- `Year` — Release year of the album.
- `Popularity` — Track popularity score (0–100).
- `Energy` — Measure of intensity and activity (0.0–1.0).
- `Duration` — Track length in a time string format.
- `Key` and `Mode` — Musical key and mode of the track.

## Reproducibility

- The raw data file in `data/` is not modified by the code.
- All results (plots) are generated by knitting `doc/stevienicksdiscography.Rmd`.
- The analysis does not rely on random sampling, so no random seed is required.

## Dependencies

This project was developed and tested in R version 4.5.1.

Required packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "readr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "janitor",
  "ggplot2", "lubridate", "viridis", "ggrepel"
))
```
